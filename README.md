# Student Management System

Done as a part of NITK GSDC Android Study Jams 2021  

## The task: 
Create a student management program with Kotlin, wherein a user can login as an admin(with appropriate credentials) or as a student.  

Let there be 3 subjects - (Math, English, Science).  

The admin has the power to look at all the students' marks(Math,English,Science - Overall %) and to modify those marks.  

The students can just view their individual subject marks.  
If admin modifies a particular subject marks for a given student, the overall percentage of the student should change accordingly.
